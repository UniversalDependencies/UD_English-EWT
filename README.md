Universal Dependencies - English Dependency Treebank
Universal Dependencies English Web Treebank v2.15 -- 2024-11-15
https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT


# Summary

A Gold Standard Universal Dependencies Corpus for English,
built over the source material of the English Web Treebank
LDC2012T13 (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T13).


# Introduction

The corpus comprises 254,820 words and 16,622 sentences, taken from five genres
of web media: weblogs, newsgroups, emails, reviews, and Yahoo! answers. See the
LDC2012T13 documentation for more details on the sources of the sentences. The
trees were automatically converted into Stanford Dependencies and then
hand-corrected to Universal Dependencies. All the basic dependency annotations have
been single-annotated, a limited portion of them have been double-annotated,
and subsequent correction has been done to improve consistency. Other aspects
of the treebank, such as Universal POS, features and enhanced dependencies, has
mainly been done automatically, with very limited hand-correction.

# Structure

This directory contains a corpus of sentences annotated using Universal
Dependencies annotation. The corpus comprises 254,818 words and 16,622
sentences (see [stats](stats.xml)), taken from various web media including
weblogs, newsgroups, emails, reviews, and Yahoo! answers;
see the LDC2012T13 documentation for more details on the source of the sentences.
The trees were automatically converted into Stanford Dependencies and then
hand-corrected to Universal Dependencies. All the dependency annotations have been
single-annotated, and a limited portion of them have been double-annotated with
interannotator agreement at approximately 96%. The sentence IDs include the genre
and the original LDC2012T13 filename.

This corpus is compatible with the CoNLL-U format defined for Universal
Dependencies. See:

   https://universaldependencies.org/format.html

The dependency taxonomy can be found on the Universal Dependencies web site:

   http://www.universaldependencies.org

For the conversion to v2, we performed an automatic conversion with extensive
spot-checking, and manual adjudication of ambiguous cases.

Most enhanced dependencies were automatically obtained by running an adapted version
of the converter by Schuster and Manning (2016). These dependencies have **not** been
manually checked. Enhanced dependencies for *reduced* relative clauses were added in
v2.14.

# Idiosyncratic MISC Attributes

The MISC column contains a few attributes that are not documented as part of the
[general UD guidelines](https://universaldependencies.org/misc.html), but are
experimental and specific to EWT. These are not necessarily systematically applied,
and are subject to change in future versions:

- `Exclamative=Yes`: Clause bearing exclamative syntax (to disambiguate from interrogatives).
- `Depictive=Yes`: Indicates the secondary predicate is semantically depictive.
- `FlatType`: Explains the use of [`flat`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/flat) for a special kind of entity.
  Marked on the first word of the flat expression. Current values:
    * `Enumerated`: a [numbered entity](https://universaldependencies.org/en/dep/nmod-desc.html#numbered-entities),
      e.g. _Chapter 1_
    * `Filename`
    * `Iconic`: e.g. spelled-out words
    * `NumericLocator`: a complex section number in a text, e.g. _5.1 ( b )_
    * `Postcode` e.g. _M5J 1S9_
    * `Phone`: a telephone number
- `Mentioned=Yes`: A metalinguistic mention (as opposed to a use) of a term.
- `MissingWordAfter=Yes`: Indicates that an unspecified word would need to be inserted to make
  the sentence grammatical.
- `MissingWordsAfter`: Value is a specific word or words that can be inferred as having been
  accidentally omitted.
- `Promoted=Yes`: Makes explicit that a word has been promoted to the head of the phrase,
  explaining its apparently anomalous context. NOTE: Applied in an ad hoc fashion; many cases
  of promotion are not marked.
- `Signature=Yes`: Indicates a trailing phrase within a sentence interpreted as the author's
  signature. Only applied to 1 token.
- `SpecialEncoding=Yes`: Indicates an unusual character encoding (see
  [issue 83](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/issues/83)).
- `Superlocation=Yes`: Indicates the `nmod:unmarked` phrase is a containing-location (or organization)
  of a more specific place or subunit (see [issue 588](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/issues/588)).
  Most commonly used for "CITY, STATE" combinations like _Dallas, **Texas**_.
  Others include "HOUSE_NUMBER **STREET**", "ORGANIZATION **BRANCH_LOCATION**", and "JOB_TITLE, **ORGANIZATION**".
  Note that major fields of full postal addresses sequenced into a "sentence" attach as `list`,
  so they will not bear this attribute.
- `TemporalNPAdjunct=Yes`: Indicates an adjunct previously annotated `obl:tmod` or `nmod:tmod`.
  May become obsolete if entity annotations are introduced.

# Known Issues

The issue tracker at <https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/issues>
documents many yet-to-be-resolved analysis challenges. Significant among these:

 - Many free relatives are incorrectly analyzed as interrogative.
